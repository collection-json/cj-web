= Collection+JSON Tutorials : Consuming a Cj Response from a Client
:Author: Mike Amundsen
:Email: mamund@yahoo.com

In this short tutorial you'll get a chance to see what it is like to 
consume http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/[Collection+JSON](Cj) 
responses emitted by a server. This is a very brief example
written as a console client in http://nodejs.org[nodejs]. This sample app focuses
on the process of accepting, parsing, and rendering Cj responses and
leaves out details of any complex full-screen rendering and other
client-side processing.

[WARNING]
============
This does not cover server-side generation of Cj responses. If you're
looking for an example of coding for a 'server' you can check out
the http://amundsen.com/media-types/tutorials/collection/tutorial-01.html[Generating 
a Cj Response from a Server] tutorial.
============

Even though this tutorial illustrates a console client, it still covers the
basics of writing client apps for the Cj hypermedia format. This includes:

 . Accepting a Cj Response
 . Handling Cj Items
 . Handling Cj Queries
 . Handling Cj Write Templates
 . Handling Cj Error Responses
